## About me
*Archaeology is not an exact science.* -Dr. Rene Belloq 1936

I retired from the Air Force 8 years ago. I got my A.A in Archaeology from Pima Community College (one of the *best* archaeology prgrams in the country, IMHO) and then went on to ~~lose my mind~~ dual major in Classics and Anthropology here at the U of A. Currently, I work at the Tree-Ring Lab and I would like to be able to use GIS to help further our knowledge of events at the end of the Bronze Age.
